Hello Every body!

This was one of my newby hacking projects of my college.
It contains image processing using PIL/Image lib in python & getting and posting to a website.
And it's actually hacking a login page which contains finding the password by the status response and hacking the captcha picture which is formed by 
sticking smaller pictures containing each number from Zero to Ten.

Hope you enjoy it
